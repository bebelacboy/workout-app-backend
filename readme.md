# Workout App (Backend)
## About
A dynamic workout planner web application made for my personal purpose. As someone who actively works out every day, I wanted a more manageable way to track my progress over time. This web app facilitates the users to search exercises instruction, create their workout plan, track their exercise progresses, and record their workout histories. The whole system is developed by myself single-handedly.
